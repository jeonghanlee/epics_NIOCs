# epics_NIOCs

This envrionment may help users to setup the multiple soft IOCs on a Linux Host. The information comes from *How to Make Channel Access Reach Multiple Soft IOCs on a Linux Host* [1]. However, the reference [1] is incorrect to get ip address and broadcast within scripts. Here I update it in order to use the morden Linux network command line tools, i.e., ip. The new EPICS web site [3] has the up-to-date information. 


## Target OSs

* Rocky 9

#$ Tested
* Debian 8/9
* CentOS 7.5


## Without ReStart NetworkManager

```sh
niocs (master)$ bash nioc_setup.bash 
#
Creating epicsNIOCs for Debian System
#
#
Installing epicsNIOCs to /etc/network/if-up.d/
#
Installing epicsNIOCs to /etc/network/if-post-down.d/
#
Can you see them in there? >>>

-rwxr-xr-x 1 root root 826 Aug 13 23:27 /etc/network/if-post-down.d/epicsNIOCs

>>>> NetworkManager will be restarted.

#
One should restart NetworkManager later.
sudo systemctrl restart NetworkManager
#
#
Please check the following EPICS VARIABLES:
# 
EPICS_CA_AUTO_ADDR_LIST : xxx
EPICS_CA_ADDR_LIST      : x.x.x.x x.x.x.x
#
# ---------------------------------------------------
# "If you need connections between IOCs on one host,
#  please add the broadcast address of the loopback  
#  interface (usually 127.255.255.255) to each IOC's 
#  EPICS_CA_ADDR_LIST"                         Ralph

## Manual Setup

Please look at scripts directory, drop it into a proper directory.
* Debian : epicsNIOCs_Debian
* CentOS : epicsNIOCs_CentOS

## Note

If one calls *caget* or *camonnitor* with multiple PVs exist in multiple IOCs, each IOC may return the following message:

```sh
CAS: UDP send to x.x.x.x:44648 failed - Operation not permitted

```
The detailed discussion one can find in Issue #1 [2].
